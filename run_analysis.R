## The goal is to fetch data and process it to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

## Data https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
